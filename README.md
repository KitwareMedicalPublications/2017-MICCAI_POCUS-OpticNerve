Abstract
--------

We present an algorithm to automatically estimate the di- ameter of the optic nerve sheath from ocular ultrasound images. The optic nerve sheath diameter provides a proxy for measuring intracra- nial pressure, a life threating condition frequently associated with head trauma. Early treatment of elevated intracranial pressures greatly im- proves outcomes and drastically reduces the mortality rate. We demon- strate that the proposed algorithm combined with a portable ultrasound device presents a viable path for early detection of elevated intracra- nial pressure in remote locations and without access to trained medical imaging experts.
